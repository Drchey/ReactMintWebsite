                At inception, the NSPM Plc had an authorized share capital base
                of two hundred thousand pounds divided into 100,000 ordinary
                shares of 2.00 pounds each with The Ministry of Finance
                Incoporated (MOFI) with 55%, Thomas De La Rue International
                Limited (TDLR) owning 40% and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)
                with 5%.

                In 1973, the joint venture agreement was reviewed, resulting in
                the following shareholding structure, which was maintained with
                MOFI owning 55%,TDLR owning 25% and the CBN owning 20%.

                In November, 2002, the shareholders passed two other resolutions
                â€“ splitting the 8.5 billion ordinary shares of N1 each to 17
                billion ordinary shares of 50k each and transforming the Company
                to a Public Limited Liability Company (PLC). These resolutions
                became necessary in view of the planned privatization of the
                Company. To this end the FGN consolidated the loans owed by NSPM
                PLC. into shares, thereby changing the share holding structure.
