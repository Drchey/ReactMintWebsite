            Part of our expansion strategy is to source raw materials locally as a logical first step,
             and this initiative inspired the establishment of an indigenous company in partnership with 
             a renown technical partner for the production of security inks in Nigeria. 
             A Memorandum of Understanding was signed on the 19 of June, 1987, for the formation of a company 
             under the business name of Tawada Limited.
              The shareholders in this company being NSPM Plc (60%) and SICPA S. A. of Switzerland (40%).
               Tawada Limited came into existence as a result of the backward integration policy of the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Plc
                (NSPM Plc) and the willingness of SICPA S. A. of Switzerland to go into a joint venture arrangement 
                for the manufacture of security and commercial printing inks in Nigeria. 
            The Tawada Limited has since commenced production of high-quality security inks.
